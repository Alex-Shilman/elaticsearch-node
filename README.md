# Elasticsearch with Node.js

> Free open-source in-depth tutorial on elasticsearch with node.js


## Project description

These are two simple Elasticsearch applications that do following things:

* `elastic-stack` demonstrates usage of Elasticsearch along with Kibana and Logstash for logging with
  [pino.js](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)
* `search` demonstrates usage of Elasticsearch for data querying (based on OSMNames)

Data used for search example can be [found here](https://github.com/OSMNames/OSMNames/releases/tag/v2.0.3)
